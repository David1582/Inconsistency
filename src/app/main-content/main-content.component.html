        <p>What is an inconsistency? Two major types of continuity errors are plot holes and inconsistencies. Many times continuity errors can exist for a simple reason, usually becaause everyone involved simply forgot or because it looks cooler the way it is.<br><br>
        <b>Inconsistency: </b>A prime example of a cinematic error is how the strength of superheroes can sometimes vary without reason. In one scene Captain America's punches are blocked by average humans and in another you see him hold back Thanos's hand. <br><br>
        <b>Plot Hole: </b>Plot holes can be oddities that never get resolved and are often overlooked by both the writers and the audience. An example of this can be something like the classical movie Cinderella. The Godmother warns her that everything reverts to their original status before the magical transformations like the carriage and animals but the single sole slipper conveniently kept it's form for the Prince to find her. Of course you can always explain them away and say that the Godmother knew all along and purposely prevented the slippers from transforming back. The counterargument is that Cinderella and the Prince were already falling in love at the ball, why not let her keep her appearance there? The counter-counterargument is that the Godmother saw 14 million and 6 hundred and 5 scenarios and in only one does Cinderella fall in love with the Prince. And that's a fair call to make, however, because the explanation is never given or shown we are forced to come up with the explanation these inconsistencies ourselves. Listed directly below are the most crucial inconsistencies for the movie so sit back, relax and grab your tinfoil hats.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Do you ever watch a movie and ask yourself, <b>"But why didn't they...?"</b></p><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do you love when that one friend that won't stop talking about why event xyz could never happen during the movie?</p><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do you like getting upset?</p><br>
          </li>
